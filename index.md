# I'm here

I am interested in social issues and am working on solving them using technology.  So far, for example, in order to solve a few problems in Cambodian libraries, I made an electronic library of copyright-free books with Raspberry Pi and conducted a project at a Cambodian high school.  In this way, we are working to solve social issues using technology.
